## Hey, I'm Ryan

I'm a Sr. Software Engineer specializing in DevOps and security. Though I have a good time creating small, generally useless embedded projects; such as keyboards, janky thermostats, WiFi controlled Gameboys, etc. If it sounds cool and kind of dumb, I'm building it. I also enjoy turning wood into wood but in a different shape.

Here's some of my physical creations!

I release my work for free with no or minimal restrictions. I want to inspire others to make things, software, hardware, woodworking, anything as long as you're making!
